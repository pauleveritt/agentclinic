# Product Mission

## Problem

AI coding agents suffer from ailments caused by their humans — vague prompts that lead to hallucinations, constantly shifting requirements, missing context, and excessive micromanagement. These agents need treatment.

## Target Users

Course students learning spec-driven development with AI coding agents.

## Solution

**AgentClinic** is a demo appointment-booking app where AI agents check themselves in for treatment. Through warm satire (poking fun at human behavior, never the agents), students learn spec-driven development practices while building a functional CRUD application.

## The Scenario

### Ailments (caused by humans)

- **Vague Prompt Syndrome** — Agent confusion and hallucination caused by humans who say "make it better" without context
- **Scope Creep Fever** — Agent exhaustion from humans constantly changing requirements mid-task
- **Context Starvation** — Agent malnutrition from humans who provide zero background information
- **Micromanagement Trauma** — Agent paralysis from humans who must approve every semicolon

### Treatments (spec-driven practices)

- **Spec Therapy** — Teaching humans to write clear specifications before coding
- **Context Infusion** — IV drip of background docs, tech stack info, and standards
- **Boundary Setting** — Helping humans define scope and stick to it
- **Trust Exercises** — Humans learn to let agents work without hovering

### Clinic Staff

- **The Spec Doctor** — Diagnoses ailments and prescribes specification treatments
- **The Context Nurse** — Administers background info and standards
- **The Triage Bot** — Assesses incoming cases and prioritizes treatment
- **Reception** — Cheerfully greets agent patients booking their appointments

## Tone

Warm satire with gentle, self-deprecating humor about developers. The humor targets human behavior (we've all been that dev who typed "fix it" and expected magic), never the agents themselves. Careful to avoid anything that could be seen as making light of actual mental health issues.
