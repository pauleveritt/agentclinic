# Tech Stack

## Frontend

- **React** with **TypeScript** for type-safe UI development

## Backend

- **Node.js** with **Express** framework for API endpoints

## API Documentation

- **OpenAPI/Swagger** for interactive API documentation
  - Auto-generated from route definitions
  - Swagger UI at `/api-docs` for testing endpoints during demos
  - Great for teaching RESTful API design

## Database

- **SQLite** for simple, file-based data persistence (ideal for demos and local development)
- **Prisma** ORM for type-safe database access and migrations
- **Seed data** pre-loaded for instant demo readiness — no setup friction, boots ready to show

## Testing

- **Vitest** for fast, Vite-native test runner
- **React Testing Library** for component testing
